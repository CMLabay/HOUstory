# HOUstory: *Our city, your story*

## Value proposition
Promote Houston as a city with rich, historical backgrounds and landmarks via mobile-guided tours. 

- Mobile App, geocache of our landmarks. 
- Points based system for badges, swag, and discounts to local businesses along selected routes. 

## Data source
[OpenData: Historic Sites & Landmarks](https://cohgis-mycity.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/historic-sites-landmarks?geometry=-95.408%2C29.754%2C-95.346%2C29.767&selectedAttribute=AGENT_PH)

## Current Stack
Vanilla JS, Bootstrap, CSS, Jquery. We can refactor to the full stack preference of sponsor.  

## Next steps
- Geolocation to automatically check player in when near a historic site
- Reach out to local businesses and stakeholders to gauge interest
- Step-by-step navigation between multiple sites
